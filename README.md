# Semi-Supervised-Topic-model-for-auto-labelling


Objective:

Use topic model to map and label transaction data into various categories.


Our dataset contain 176 rows and for we to get a better mapping or topic, we need a corpus more than what we have. 


So, therefore, we will use just three categories for this project and as we get more dataset, we will product more topics.


**Selected topics:**
- Online transactions
- Charges
- Others



**Steps:**
- Data cleaning
- data preprocessing
- BERT Topic mode
- Guided Bert Topic Model
- Guided LDA model
- Evaluation 
- Save model
- Topic mapping for auto labelling
- Vectorization for Baseline Classifier
- Baseline Classifier training and export model
- Baseline model sample prediciton
